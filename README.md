ABOUT THE GAME
* Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. 
* The word to be guessed is represented by a series of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. 
* The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and with each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn.
* The hangman figure typically consists of a gallows and a stick figure. Parts of the stick figure are added for each incorrect guess, starting with the head, body, arms, and legs.
